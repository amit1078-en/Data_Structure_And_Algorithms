/*
Bridge in a graph is defined as the the edge if it was removed graoh becomes disconnected example 
   
1 - 0 - 3
I /     I
2       4

 in above graph if edge 0-3 is disconnected graoh becomes disconnected or if edge  3 - 4 is disconnected it also becomes disconnected
 
 we can do this question via tarjans algorithm
